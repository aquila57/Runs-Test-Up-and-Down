Testing instructions for all the runs test programs in this
repository.

eegl64 random number generator

Run runsa to apply the runs test up and down for the
eegl64 uniform random number generator.  There is
no parameter.  See the template repository for information
about the eegl64 generator.

./runsa

This test is expected to pass the Z-score test and the chi
square test.

--------

etaus random number generator

Run runsa to apply the runs test up and down for the
etaus uniform random number generator.  There is
no parameter.  See the etaus repository for information
about thhis generator.

./runsetaus

This test is expected to pass the Z-score test and the chi
square test.

--------

Fibonacci random number generator

Run runsfibo to apply the runs test up and down
to the fibonacci random number generator.
There is no parameter.

./runsfibo

This test is expected to fail.

--------

64 bit LFSR random number generator

Run runslfsr to apply the runs test up and down
to the 64 bit LFSR random number generator.
There is no parameter.

./runslfsr

This test is expected to fail.

--------

32 bit RANDU random number generator

Run ruruns to apply the runs test up and down
to the 32 bit RANDU random number generator.
There is no parameter.

./ruruns

The RANDU random number generator passes the Z-score
test but fails the chi square test.

--------

The sine wave random number generator

Run runsine to apply the runs test up and down
to the sine wave random number generator.
There is no parameter.

./runsine

The sine wave random number generator passes the Z-score test
and the chi square test.

--------

GNU Scientific Library random number generators

Run runall.sh to apply the runs test up and down
to the entire collection of GNU Scientific Library random number
generators.  There is no parameter for this procedure, but
the list of random number generators is in a file, called
allgsl.lst.

./runall.sh

The output from this test is in a file, called allgsl.out.
You may browse this file to see the results.  The following
GSL generators fail this test.  The rest of the generators
pass.

	random32-bsd
	random32-glibc2
	random32-libc5
	randu

--------

Dieharder package random number generators

Run tstdie.sh to apply the runs up and down test to the
dieharder collection of random number generators.  There
is one parameter, the number of the dieharder generator.

./tstdie.sh RNG_number

Example,

./tstdie.sh 053

This example runs the test on the dieharder taus2 generator.

To find a list of dieharder random number generators,
enter the following dieharder command.

dieharder -g -l
