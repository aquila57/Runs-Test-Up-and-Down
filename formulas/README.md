# Formulas

This subdirectory contains images of formulas used in the runs
up and down test.

These formulas are used for computing Z-score and expected run
length for the chi square test.

The formulas here are taken from the document by Professor Xiannong
Meng at Bucknell.  The programs in this repository are based on
these formulas.
